        <footer>Addendum
            <p> I did not have many problems writing my JavaScript code. I found the code to create a button and
            I wrote a change color function that would change the color of a funny spring themed joke. The only difficulty I had was setting the color of the punchline.
            At first, I had the joke and the punchline in two seperate p tags but only the joke would change colors when the buttons were clicked. I thought that if they were in the same p tag that it would work but I didn't want it to be all one sentence.
            I googled line break tags for html and found the br tag which solved my problem!

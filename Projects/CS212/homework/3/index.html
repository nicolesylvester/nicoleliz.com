    <div>To implement this homework, I first used Google Fonts, "Get Started with the Google Font API" instructions to format my html file. Then I searched through free Google fonts and picked a cool and spooky font. I selected the font and found the name, family and link and copied and pasted this information
into the head section of my html file. Lastly, I set a font size so my writing was readable.

		</h3>

		<h5>What I Know and What I Want to Find Out (399 words)</h5>
		<p>
		<div>&emsp;When picturing the stereotypical computer scientist, if the image that comes to mind is a man, it is a very warranted image. Most of the computer science field is made up of men with only 20% of professionals being women (<em>Women in computer science</em>). Because of this haunting proportion, many organizations and schools have encouraged women to join STEM and more specifically Computer Science. However, over the years, the percentage of women seems to have plateaued. With the extra awareness and encouragement to get women to join the field, why are there still so few women in Computer Science? 
		</div>
		</p>

		<p>
		<div>&emsp;I am determined to find answers to this question because as an undergraduate in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems I have seen the disproportionate number of women in the program first hand. I am a member of a very small club called Women Who Compute. As a club, we also go to Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) club meetings and have invited them to ours. However, when ACM, a club with over 200 members, mostly men, were invited to come to Women Who Compute to show support, only one person showed up. Aside from the lack of support from male students, women in Computer Science are also tasked with the intimidating reality of only male teachers and TA’s. Personally, I have yet to have a female teacher for any of my major specific classes. When faced with these disproportionate numbers, I know first-hand that it is discouraging, intimidating and uncomfortable. As I walk across the front of my computer science class every Tuesday and Thursday to find my seat, I feel the heavy gaze of stereotypical computer scientists.  The nervous chill that runs down my neck makes me walk a little faster to my seat. When I sit down, I sink into my seat praying that this is not the day I get called on and make a fool of myself in front of all the men that I'm trying to prove myself and my skills to. I think that understanding how this field has gotten so toxic and intimidating towards women will provide me with a better understanding of the male dominated field of computer science that I will be entering in a few years and tools I can use to make the field more welcoming for other women to hopefully help close the gender gap.

		<h5> My Search Process(1137 words) 
		</h5>
		<p>
		<div>
		</div>&emsp;I started my research with a quick google search of the percentage of women in computer science to spark my passion and a little bit of rage. The first source I found was from University of California, San Diego’s The Guardian. Lara Sanli, a student and the author of “Impostor Syndrome in Computer Science,” provides background information outlining how computer science became the male dominated field that it is today. The very first programmers were actually women and they played a crucial part in World War II efforts. However, Sanli informs that in the 1970’s with the creation of personal computers there was a shift in genders and, “more privileged children began to spend their spare time tinkering with [computers] and exploring the functions of computers. Parenting techniques shifted to reflect the presence of the computer [and] … it became more likely for boys to be gifted computers than girls.” Because wealthy families could afford computers, boys began to hone in their skills at a young age and now as college students, had more experience than girls simply due to lack of exposure and ingrained societal gender roles in their parents. Sanli also adds that from these differences in experience, “An elite culture developed around computers and computer science, leading many of those who lacked the privilege of having satisfied what became these unspoken coding prerequisites for many university CS programs, as well as those who struggled to keep up with the pace of these programs, to feel like impostors.” This article was very helpful in answering my question and led me to think about the effects of imposter syndrome on this gender gap.
		</p>

		<p>
		<div>&emsp;Women who have less coding experience fall victim to imposter syndrome and feel as though they are not as smart or capable as their male counterparts. The next article I found was a very formal research article that provided information on stereotypes and their effect on imposter syndrome. Adam Rosenstein and his fellow authors of  “Identifying the Prevalence of the Impostor Phenomenon among Computer Science Students,” conducted a study that “found that there was a statistically significant difference between the populations of male students (52%) and female students (71.2%) in CS who reported feelings of IP.” This feeling of inadequacy and discouragement could cause anyone to change their major. In contrast, educated STEM women that stick with the major and begin to enter the workforce were found to apply for jobs that were below their educational qualifications (Galperin). However, imposter syndrome is not only from being in the uncomfortable environment of computer science, but can arise even before women pursue their coding interests. The same search article introduced above discusses why there is this difference of male and female students affected by imposter syndrome. Rosenstein claims that “individuals might have preconceived notions as to what type of person constitutes as a cultural fit within CS. This might lead to members of underrepresented groups feeling as if they do not belong regardless of their technical competence and academic abilities.” This article was shockingly relatable because I know the exact feeling of not fitting into the small box that is a computer scientist. The stereotypical image of a smart, nerdy, white man with thick glasses and maybe forgot to shower last night scares away some women who are interested in the major because they feel they would not fit in and therefore do not think twice about pursuing computer science.

		<p>
		<div>&emsp;This feeling of underrepresentation unfortunately continues into the workplace. The next source I found through a quick google search was an informal blog on a website called “Code Like a Girl” that celebrates women in technology. The website was very informative and I even read some of the other articles in my free time. I specifically utilized the post, “Being an Imposter Woman in Tech” to answer my question in which Joy Ebertz, a Senior Staff Software Engineer informs that even though women are slowly infiltrating the male dominated workplace, “...statistics show that we [women] fail to negotiate for our salaries, we struggle with imposter syndrome and we have to fight extra hard not to be seen as bossy or abrasive.” This struggle against the unsupportive male coworkers, our own thoughts, and societal norms becomes more overwhelming than the actual job. However, when women overcome their imposter syndrome and become successful, men use it against them. 
		</div>
		</p>

		<p>
		<div>&emsp;This unfortunately led me to my next source, “Furor on Claim Women's Choices Create Gender Gap in Comp Sci.” By the sound of the title, I knew I was going to be infuriated after reading it, however I wanted to get all sides in order to properly answer my question. The article offers somewhat of a counterclaim stating women's choices, not sexism, is the real reason behind the gender gap. Scott Jaschik reports the words from Stuart Reges’ article defending a fired Google Engineer stating, “we have harvested the low-hanging fruit by eliminating overt discrimination and revamping policies and procedures that favored men. But the leveling off of numbers reflects the choices of women, not discrimination.”  He pushes accountability and blame on women rather than acknowledging the fact that men make women feel unwelcome and evidence proves this. Last year in my Women Gender Studies class we learned about GamerGate, the anonymous campaign dedicated to harassing women in the field of video game development and gatekeeping video game development from women. I remembered this as I was reading Jaschik’s article and decided to do more research about this campaign in which I found the podcast All Things Considered.  Brianna Wu, a guest speaker on the podcast and a woman targeted by the movement tells listeners “…many women in games would quit rather than continue speaking up. So what they did is they sent us rape threats. They sent us death threats, and they harassed us until many women simply left the game industry.” This campaign to scare women into quitting creates a toxic environment that many women would rather avoid altogether. Straight, cis, white men continue to drive women out of computer science and resist efforts to level the proportions. Another shocking fact that Wu shares is that the campaign “had my address. They had information about my family. They were very specific about the violence they were going to do to me. It was so serious that, actually, the FBI got involved.” This harassment from what was a majority of the computer science field can make women feel as if they are the odd one out with no one in their corners. Hearing the terrible things GamerGate threatened these women with in this podcast aided in answering my question in regards to why women are deterred from the field even though there are so many groups and websites encouraging college aged women to major in computer science.

		<h5>What I Concluded/How This Search Matters (332 words)
		</h5>

		<p>
		<div>&emsp;Through this journey to find my answer, I ended up asking myself more questions than I anticipated. My research was smooth and transitioned from one sub question to another as they arose. As I read articles and listened to podcasts, I was led to more questions and more sources.  I knew the shocking number of women in computer science was low but I did not realize how many factors truly contributed to this. However, no matter how many reasons there are for women to not pursue computer science, many of the reasons boil down to the one simple thing: Men! Men overwhelmingly took computer science from women during the 70’s and have been gatekeeping it ever since. Society unconsciously associates computers with men and this stereotype has made many women feel as if they are not good enough or don't fit in. Besides the internal drive away from technology that women face, they also are confronted with intimidation from their peers. Male peers make women feel uncomfortable then deny it or threaten women when they speak up.

		<p>
		<div>&emsp;The answers I found during my research impact my life everyday on campus in all my major related courses. After researching the factors behind why women run from computer science, I am able to identify these in my classes and not let them get to me as much. I rationalize my feeling by understanding that most women go through this and out of spite, I want to pursue computer science even more. Researching this topic made me realize how passionate I am about supporting women and that more attention needs to be focused on men supporting women in technology rather than recruiting women. There is so much talk from universities and organizations persuading women to join the field but once they are here, there is little support in keeping them. I plan to continue researching this and hopefully through my I-Search can help bring awareness to the shocking statistic that is women in computer science.

		<h3> Addendum
		</h3>
		<p> For this assignment, I used a past ENG105 paper of mine. Before writing code, I split up my paper into sections depending on the headers and paragraphs. Then, I google searched HTML tags for headers and found the appropriate tags, h1 through h6. I used h3 tags for my title, works cited, and addendum. For the smaller subheadings, I used h5 tags. I wanted the title and works cited to be centered and through a quick google search, I found "style= "text-align:center;"". Next, I googled tags I would need for a paragraph, found the p and div tags, and implemented them. I copied and pasted sections of my paper at a time into the file under an article tag and I had to find the em tag to italicize one of my sources. I wanted my paragraphs to be indented and found the code "&emsp" to do so. Lastly, I wrote my addendum under a second article tag.
